Memo:

Using previously available single-cell RNA sequencing data (data that measures gene expression at the level of individual cells) from cancer cell lines (populations of cancer cells derived from a patient’s tumor, grown + immortalized in a lab), how can we explore FDA-approved antibody therapies (laboratory engineered antibodies used to target specific proteins or cell to treat diseases like cancer)? 

The FDA-approved antibody therapies in question:

Trastuzumab: Monoclonal antibody therapy that specifically targets the HER2 protein, a receptor on the surface of certain cancer cells. Overexpression of HER2 drives the growth of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers. By binding to HER2, trastuzumab inhibits tumor growth, promotes immune-mediated destruction of cancer cells, and enhances effectiveness of chemotherapy. 

Bevacizumab: Monoclonal antibody therapy that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key protein involved in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors develop new blood vessels to grow and spread. By inhibiting VEGF, bevacizumab restricts the tumor’s blood supply, limiting oxygen and nutrients needed for its growth. It is used to treat several cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney.
